###### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Jonathan, a system administrator, a full stack software developer and designer. 

Despite holding degrees in 3D Animation and Interactive Media Design, my passion for development and networking guided me toward the path of a system administrator. I find the dynamic world of software-to-network interactions more compelling and thoroughly enjoy navigating its intricacies.

## ðŸŒ± Goals and Plans

<div align="left">

I'm exploring new avenues to channel my creativity and connect with like-minded individuals who share my interests and hobbies. My goal is to create a space where I can share tips, tricks, and perhaps initiate some exciting open-source side projects. Who knows, this journey might pave the way for even more passion projects. Let's embark on this adventure and see where it takes us!
